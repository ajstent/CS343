    "# Optimizers via Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimizer is an algorithm for adjusting a model's weights toward a loss minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's think about this as rolling a ball (a weight) downhill (toward a loss minimum). \n",
    "\n",
    "According to physics, the potential energy $E$ of the ball $~ m*g*h$ (where $m$ is mass, $g$ is gravity and $h$ is height). \n",
    "\n",
    "And the force $F$ felt by the ball is $-\\triangledown E$ (the gradient of $E$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, by Newton's second law, $F = ma$ (where $m$ is acceleration). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume a mass of 1. Now $a = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\Delta M}$ = $M(T) - M(T-1)$ ($M$ is momentum).\n",
    "\n",
    "So then $-\\triangledown E = F = M(T) - M(T-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from regular stochastic descent that $-\\triangledown E = \\eta*dx$, so $M(T) = M(T-1)-\\eta*dx$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V(T-1)$ is the velocity at the previous time. We want a *controlled* descent so we can add a coefficient to weight the degree to which the velocity at the previous time controls the velocity at this time (momentum): $M(T) = \\mu M(T-1)-\\eta*dx$. If $\\mu = 0$ we have regular SGD."

    "For SGD with momentum, we:\n",
    "1. Use the gradient (acceleration) to update velocity via $M(T) = \\mu M(T-1)-\\eta*dx$.\n",
    "2. Use the velocity to update the position of the \"ball\" via $x(T) = x(T-1) + M(T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you iterate over these steps, $\\mu$ accumulates exponentially.\n",

    "# Adam\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam builds on SGD with momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with SGD with momentum is that the learning rate $\\eta$ affects all the weights equally, regardless of their individual gradients. By contrast, Adam adapts the learning rate dynamically per weight/bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is that if $dx$ is small, we want to increase the learning rate; if $dx$ is large, we want to lower the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Adam is a modification to how we calculate $M(T)$: $M(T) = \\beta_1*M(T-1) + (1-B_1)*dx$. We also define $M_t(T) = \\frac{M(T)}{1-\\beta_1^T}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want $\\beta_1$ to be a running average, so we can fix it to prefer newer vs older velocities. We also need to calculate a penalty term, $V(T) = \\beta_2*V(T-1) + (1-\\beta_2)*dx^2$. We also define $V_t(T) = \\frac{V(T)}{1-\\beta_2^T}$.\n",
    "\n",
